# Project Overview & Objectives

### **Problem Statement**

Modern applications require different access levels for users such as Admin, Moderator, User, and Guest. Without a proper role-based access system, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive features, causing security risks and data misuse. A scalable and secure solution is needed to manage multiple roles effectively.

### **Expected Outcome**

* A secure and reliable Multi-Role Access Control App.
* Prevention of unauthorized access.
* User-friendly dashboards based on roles.
